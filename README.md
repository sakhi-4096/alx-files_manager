# Files manager
File managers in JavaScript are tools or libraries that enable developers to incorporate file management functionalities into web applications. These tools provide users with the ability to interact with files and folders, perform operations like uploading, downloading, organizing, and editing files within the application's interface.

## Features
* **File Upload and Download:** Enable users to upload files from their local system to the application and download files stored within the application.
* **File Organization:** Allow users to organize files and folders, create directories, move, copy, rename, and delete files within the file manager interface.
* **File Editing:** Provide capabilities for editing files directly within the file manager, such as text editing, image cropping, or document editing functionalities.
* **Search and Filter:** Offer search and filter functionalities to help users quickly locate specific files or folders within the file manager interface.
* **Drag-and-Drop Support:** Support drag-and-drop functionality for easy file manipulation, enabling users to drag files between folders or upload files by dragging them onto the interface.
* **Multi-File Operations:** Allow users to perform batch operations on multiple files simultaneously, such as selecting multiple files for deletion or moving.
